
Satellite looking into missing Malaysia flight detects 'suspected crash area',Jethro Mullen,"A Chinese satellite looking into the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 ""observed a suspected crash area at sea,"" a Chinese government agency said -- a potentially pivotal lead into what has been a frustrating search for the Boeing 777.
China's State Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense announced the discovery, including images of what it said were ""three suspected floating objects and their sizes."" The objects aren't small at 13 by 18 meters (43 by 59 feet), 14 by 19 meters and 24 by 22 meters.
The images were captured on March 9 -- which was the day after the plane went missing -- but weren't released until Wednesday.
The Chinese agency gave coordinates of 105.63 east longitude, 6.7 north latitude, which would put it in waters northeast of where it took off in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and south of Vietnam.
This isn't the first time authorities have announced they were looking at objects or oil slicks that might be tied to aircraft. Still, it is the latest and comes on the same day that officials, rather than narrowing the search area, more than doubled it from the day earlier to nearly 27,000 square nautical miles (35,000 square miles).
Earlier Wednesday, officials announced they had once again expanded the search area. It now covers nearly 27,000 square nautical miles, more than double the size of the area being searched just a day before.
Such a dramatic expansion at this stage of the investigation is troubling, said CNN aviation expert Richard Quest.
""At this stage in the investigation and search and rescue, I would have expected to see by now a much more defined understanding of what the route was, where the plane was headed and a narrowing of the search consequent upon that,"" he said on CNN's ""New Day.""

Indeed, the lack of a clear direction prompted Vietnam to say that it's pulling back on its search efforts until Malaysian authorities come up with better information on where to look for the plane.
Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished early Saturday with 239 people on board during a flight between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing.
Phan Quy Tieu, Vietnam's vice minister of transportation, said the information Malaysian officials provided was ""insufficient.""
""Up until now we only had one meeting with a Malaysian military attache,"" he said.
For now, Vietnamese teams will stop searching the sea south of Ca Mau province, the southern tip of Vietnam, and shift the focus to areas east of Ca Mau, said Doan Luu, the director of international affairs at the Vietnamese Civil Aviation Authority.
At a news conference Wednesday, Malaysian transportation minister Hishamuddin Bin Hussein defended his government's approach.
""We have been very consistent in the search,"" he said.

Confusion over flight path
But even figuring out where authorities believe the plane may have gone down has been a difficult and shifting proposition.
In the immediate aftermath of the plane's disappearance, search and rescue efforts were focused on the Gulf of Thailand, along the expected flight path between Malaysia and Vietnam.
Over the weekend, authorities suddenly expanded their search to the other side of the Malay Peninsula, in the Strait of Malacca, where search efforts now seem to be concentrated.
That location is hundreds of miles off the plane's expected flight path.
An explanation appeared to come Tuesday when a senior Malaysian Air Force official told CNN that the Air Force had tracked the plane to a spot near the small island of Palau Perak off Malaysia's west coast in the Straits of Malacca.
The plane's identifying transponder had stopped sending signals, too, said the official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
Malaysia's civilian administration appeared to dispute the report, however.
The New York Times quoted a spokesman for the Malaysian prime minister's office as saying Tuesday that military officials had told him there was no evidence the plane had flown back over the Malay Peninsula to the Straits of Malacca.
The Prime Minister's office didn't immediately return calls from CNN seeking comment.
Then, in another shift, Malaysian authorities said at a news conference Wednesday that radar records reviewed in the wake of the plane's disappearance reveal an unidentified aircraft traveling across the Malay Peninsula and some 200 miles into the Straits of Malacca.
However, it wasn't clear whether that radar signal represented Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Gen. Rodzali Daud, head of the Malaysian Air Force, said at the news conference.
Rodzali said that officials are still ""examining and analyzing all possibilities"" when it comes to the plane's flight path.
Malaysian officials are asking experts from the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority and National Transportation Safety Board to help them analyze the radar data.
The FAA said Wednesday that it ""stands ready to provide any necessary additional support.""
The agency has already sent two technical experts and another official to Kuala Lumpur as part of a NTSB investigative team.
How you can help find the plane
No trace
The search zones includes huge swaths of ocean on each side of the Malay Peninsula, as well as land.
Forty-two ships and 39 planes from 12 countries have been searching the sea between the northeast coast of Malaysia and southwest Vietnam, the area where the plane lost contact with air traffic controllers.
But they are also looking off the west coast of the Malay Peninsula, in the Straits of Malacca, and north into the Andaman Sea.
So far, searchers have found no trace of the plane.
What happened leading to the plane's disappearance also remains a mystery. Leading theories include hijacking, an explosion or a catastrophic mechanical failure.
Suggestions that the plane had veered off course and that its identifying transponder was not working raise obvious concerns about a hijacking, analysts tell CNN. But a catastrophic power failure or other problem could also explain the anomalies, analysts say.
In a sign authorities are looking at all options, Kuala Lumpur police told CNN they are searching the home of the airliner's Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah.
They were also questioning a man who hosted two Iranians who boarded the flight on stolen passports, the man -- Mohammad Mallaei -- told CNN on Wednesday.
Authorities have previously said they do not believe the men had any connection to terror groups.
Families' frustration
As the vexing search drags on, frustration has grown among friends and family of those who were on board.
""Time is passing by. The priority should be to search for the living,"" a middle-aged man shouted before breaking into sobs during a meeting with airline officials in Beijing on Tuesday. His son, he said, was one of the passengers aboard the plane.
Other people at the meeting also voiced their frustration at the lack of information.
Most of those on the flight were Chinese, and the Chinese government has urged Malaysia to speed up the pace of its investigation.
Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak on Wednesday appealed for patience.
""The families involved have to understand that this is something unexpected,"" Najib said. ""The families must understand more efforts have been made with all our capabilities."""
"Obama, Ukraine's PM warn Russia as Crimea heads for vote",Nick Paton Walsh,"Simferopol, Ukraine (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama and Ukrainian interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk had strong words for Russia on Wednesday as Washington again warned Moscow there will be consequences if it doesn't remove its troops from Crimea and Kiev said that it will ""never surrender.""
But Yatsenyuk also said after his meeting with Obama at the White House that Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic, wants to be a good friends with Russia.
""We will continue to say to the Russian government that if it continues on the path that is on, then not only us but the international community ... will be forced to apply a cost to Russia's violations of international law,"" Obama told reporters. ""There is another path available, and we hope that (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin is willing seize that path.""
Yatsenyuk -- who took over after the ouster of Viktor Yanukovych, the pro-Russian former president of Ukraine -- said that Ukraine is fighting for its freedom.
""We fight for our sovereignty, and we will never surrender,"" he said. Later he added that he wanted to be clear that Ukraine ""is and will be a part of the Western world"" but still a ""good friend and partner of Russia.""
Even as the leaders met earlier pro-Russian forces were tightening their grip in Crimea ahead of a secession referendum denounced by the West.
Yatsenyuk first met U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry before heading to the White House.
He will go to New York on Thursday to address the United Nations Security Council. The Ukrainian delegation will also meet with Congress, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund while in Washington, in an indication of international support for Ukraine's fledgling government.
Yatsenyuk's visit comes as breakneck preparations are under way for a Sunday referendum in Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula -- to be held largely in secret -- and tensions persist around Simferopol, Crimea's capital.
 Pro-Russian militias solidify hold Naval standoff on the Black Sea
Flights to Crimea from Kiev, Istanbul and several other cities have been suspended for the rest of the week, with only those originating from Moscow landing.
Crimeans will be able to choose between two alternatives when they vote: Do you support reuniting Crimea with Russia, as a subject of the Russian Federation? Or, do you support the restoration of the 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Crimea and Crimea's status as a part of Ukraine?
According to the 1992 Constitution, Crimea is really an independent state.
The Crimean Electoral Commission was delivering referendum ballots to regional administrative buildings, according to the body's head, Michail Malishev.
The new pro-Russian government on the peninsula in Ukraine's southeast said Tuesday that if the voters opt to join Russia, the first step will be to declare Crimea an independent and sovereign state. Then it will apply to join the Russian Federation.
Crimea's representatives have already approached Moscow with their idea. Russian leaders have greeted them with open arms.
Diplomatic pressure
Russian-speaking troops wearing no identifying insignia have Crimea firmly under their control. Many believe that they belong at least in part to Russia's military, an assertion Moscow has repeatedly denied. Russia says they are local ""self-defense"" forces.
There has been an international outcry over Crimea's push for separation and warnings that the referendum won't be recognized in Kiev or elsewhere.
Efforts to exert diplomatic pressure on Moscow continued Wednesday despite little sign that Russia is listening.
Kerry said he would meet Friday in London with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, to continue discussions on the situation in Ukraine.
Meanwhile, French President Francois Hollande told Putin, in a phone call that the referendum planned in Crimea ""has no legal basis.""
Hollande urged Putin to ""do everything to prevent the annexation of Crimea to Russia,"" saying that such a move would be unacceptable to the international community.
In a different tone, a statement from the Kremlin said Putin and Hollande had agreed to continue discussions, and France's foreign and defense ministers would travel to Moscow next week.
G7 tells Russia to back off
The G7 -- the world's leading industrial powers without Russia -- and leaders of the European Council and Commission issued a strongly worded statement calling on Russia to ""cease all efforts to change the status of Crimea contrary to Ukrainian law and in violation of international law.""
The statement urged Russia to immediately halt actions supporting the referendum.
""Any such referendum would have no legal effect. Given the lack of adequate preparation and the intimidating presence of Russian troops, it would also be a deeply flawed process which would have no moral force. For all these reasons, we would not recognize the outcome,"" it said.
It warned that the annexation of Crimea could have ""grave implications"" for the legal order protecting the sovereignty of all states. ""Should the Russian Federation take such a step, we will take further action, individually and collectively,"" it said.
Russia should pull its forces back to their pre-crisis numbers and garrisons and talk to the government in Kiev and international mediators, the leaders said.
The G7 nations -- the United States, Canada, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy and Japan -- had already suspended preparations for a planned G8 summit in the Russian city of Sochi in June in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine.
Welcome to Crimea
Well-armed men have effectively isolated the Crimean peninsula, which has an ethnic Russian majority, from the rest of Ukraine.
Tensions flared Wednesday at a Ukrainian military base in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. A CNN team saw Ukrainian forces load and cock their weapons as what appeared to be Russian soldiers moved in on the base and placed a heavy machine gun at the gates. The Russian troops then pulled back.
Passengers disembarking in Simferopol on Tuesday saw pro-Russian militiamen wearing red armbands that proclaimed their allegiance to ""the autonomous republic of Crimea.""
The men helped police search arrivals, sometimes shoving them to where they want them to stand.
""We are looking for people who are bringing in weapons. For security. From Ukraine. From Maidan,"" a guard explained, referring to Kiev's Independence Square, the epicenter of protests that toppled Yanukovych.
A saleswoman offered new cell phone cards to new arrivals -- also for security reasons, she explained.
""The fascist who wants to be President, he wants to bring his armed men here from Kiev, to disrupt our referendum. He doesn't want to negotiate, he just wants to shoot,"" she said.
A passenger arriving from Russia at the airport seemed confident about how the vote will go.
""Crimea is Russia!"" he exclaimed, as he exited.
Amid tensions over Ukraine, space cooperation goes on
Russia's reach
Assuming the referendum goes in favor of joining the Russian Federation, the newly installed Crimean Parliament will place the request to join with Moscow.
The lower house of Parliament there has announced it will debate whether to accept Crimea on March 21.
Yanukovych, currently in Russia, insists he is still the legitimate leader of Ukraine and has vowed to return to Kiev ""as soon as the circumstances allow.""
Speaking in Rostov-on-Don in southwestern Russia on Tuesday, Yanukovych slammed the interim government in Kiev as ""a gang of ultranationalists and fascists.""
Yanukovych fled Kiev on February 22 after three months of protests against his decision to scrap a trade deal with the European Union and embrace closer ties with Russia.
Less than a week later, armed men seized the Crimean parliament building in Simferopol and raised the Russian flag above it.
The Crimean Black Sea port city of Sevastopol, where Russia has a large naval base, decided to grant the Russian language official status, and the city administration started using it Wednesday.
World stage
The peninsula in the Black Sea, with a population of just over 2 million people, has stepped into the spotlight of the world stage.
The West has been preparing sanctions and at the same time telling Moscow that there is a way out of an economic and diplomatic showdown: Talk to Ukraine's new government and don't intervene militarily.
Moscow has denounced the events that led to Yanukovych's ouster as an illegitimate coup and has refused to recognize the new Ukrainian authorities.
Putin has said his government has the right to protect ethnic Russians living there.
Unarmed military and civilian observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe are now on the ground in the city of Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine, the regional security bloc said via Twitter. The team was repeatedly turned back from entering Crimea by armed men.
A report by the OSCE observer team said that although it was prevented from entering Crimea, its ""observations produced significant evidence of equipment consistent with the presence of Russian Federation military personnel (in the vicinity of) the various roadblocks encountered.""
The evidence included Russian pattern uniforms and equipment without identifying patches, as well as trucks bearing license plate numbers associated with Russia's Black Sea Fleet, the observers said.
""This report adds to our deep concerns and clearly suggests direct involvement by the Russian Federation and its agents in preventing impartial, unarmed observers from doing the work they are supposed to do,"" U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE Daniel Baer said. ""Russian encouragement of and support for illegal checkpoints is unhelpful.""
Meanwhile, the United Nations said assistant secretary-general for human rights, Ivan Simonovic, had canceled a visit to Crimea -- primarily because of the logistical challenges at Simferopol airport and because he had been informed by authorities that he could not be received.
Sanctions mooted
Eight U.S. senators, led by Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, are scheduled to travel to Ukraine in coming days.
The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a resolution condemning Russia for its military intervention in Ukraine and urging economic and other sanctions in response.
The resolution urges the Obama administration to unite with European allies to impose visa, financial, trade and other sanctions on senior Russian Federation officials, majority state-owned banks and commercial organizations.
On Tuesday, the European Commission offered Ukraine trade incentives worth about 500 million euros a year. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said it was also ""moving ahead fast"" with the implementation of an 11 billion euro ($15 billion) package of support for cash-strapped Ukraine promised last week.
Russia: 'absolutely legitimate'
Russian officials have compared Crimea's potential departure from Ukraine to Kosovo's secession from Serbia after many years of bloody civil war with its former neighbor.
Western governments recognized the separation over bitter opposition from Serbia and its historical allies in Moscow.
In a written statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry cited it as a precedent for the ""absolutely legitimate"" Crimean vote.
""The Russian Federation will respect the results of the free vote of Crimea's people during the referendum,"" it said."
