Missing Malaysia airliner: Questions and answers,Eliott C. McLaughlin,"Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared Saturday somewhere over Southeast Asia. Authorities don't know where the plane is or what happened to it. Here are 17 answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about this baffling disappearance:
Did the plane go off course?
Possibly, but not certainly. Some accounts have placed the aircraft hundreds of miles from its expected flight path to Beijing, and authorities have expanded the search area to include that possibility. But they're also still searching areas along the flight path. A big problem is that the plane's identifying transponder wasn't working, making radar determinations more difficult. International experts are reviewing Malaysian radar data in hopes of helping pin down where the plane may have gone."
